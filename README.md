# ICE 01: Webpage Redesign

In this activity, you and a team will be re-desigining a website. Effective design requires us to think about the needs, abilities, and preferences of different folks. This activity lets you put that into practice.

Your team will be designing for a demographics group of your choice. You have some flexibility with how broad or narrow you want your demographic to be. Demographics can be determined by many factors, including age, race, gender identification, sexual orientation, dietary preferences, and even fandoms! KEEP THE DEMOGRAPHIC A SECRET IN YOUR GROUP! You will try to have the rest of the class guess your demographic later.

### Instructions

1. Divide yourselves into groups of 3 - 5 students. One member from your group should go on Canvas and put all group member names under one of the empty groups that says "ICE01 Group X".

2. Decide on your demographic, and then choose from one of the following local sites to edit:

    - https://worcesterarl.org/
    - http://www.bluejeanspizza.com/
    - http://www.worcesterart.org/
    - https://www.worcester.edu/WCC/
    - https://www.firstfriendschildcare.org/
    - http://www.mywpl.org/

3. Download a local copy of the webpages your group wants to edit (`File -> Save As -> Web Page, Complete` in most browsers). Your group should decide how to share editing responsibilities. Feel free to set up a shared folder or a GitHub repo if you think it will help.

4. Using your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, edit the site to appeal to your target demographic. While you will not redesign the entire website, you should redesign 3 - 4 pages on the website. One of those pages must be the homepage. The others must be accessible from the homepage.

    - Consider fonts, colors, visual organization, mood, and other factors that relate to your target demographics. **Donâ€™t stereotype.** Be considerate.

    - You may find it helpful to visit sites you **know** are designed for your demographics group. Bear in mind, however, that many sites are poorly designed, and you can probably do better.

    - Above all, have FUN with the process.

5. Using Goole Slides, produce a slideshow that showcases your redesign. One member should share your presentation with me so that I can pull it up on the podium. The slides only need to consist of screenshots of your redesigned website.

6. One member of your group should be prepared to come up to the podium to discuss your group's design choices. See if the rest of the class can guess your target demographic. Once the demographic is revealed, share things like the major insights, design decisions, and processes you followed to arrive at your design.

7. Create a *.zip file containing all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files necessary to render and navigate your site locally. Also include a link to your presentation so that the SAs can access it. Submit your *.zip file on Canvas.
