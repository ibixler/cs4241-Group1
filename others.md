# cs4241-17a css challenge: Design for Others

In this activity, you and a team will be re-desigining a website.
Effective design requires us to think about the needs, abilities, and preferences of different folks.
This activity lets you put that into practice.

### The Twist
Your team will be designing for a demographics group that __ONLY YOUR TEAM KNOWS__.
Keep everyone else in the dark!

An example group includes:
- College students
- Teenagers

(I won’t use the above groups in class.)
You’ll get your demographics group from me after you’ve formed teams.

### The Process
Use any tools at your disposal to capture and communicate your design.
Some ideas include, but aren’t limited to:

- Hand drawn sketches
- Illustrator/Photoshop
- Keynote/Powerpoint
- Skitch/Cloudapp
- Chrome Dev tools to edit CSS

When forming teams, seek out folks with diverse skillsets that will help you knock this out.

Consider fonts, colors, visual organization, mood, and other factors that relate to your target demographics.
Don’t stereotype, be considerate.
Note that one way to do this is to visit sites you **know** are designed for your demographics group. 
Bear in mind, however, that most sites are poorly designed and you can probably do better.

### The Sites
Given your demographics info, choose from one of the following local sites:

- https://worcesterarl.org/
- http://www.bluejeanspizza.com/
- http://www.worcesterart.org/
- https://www.worcester.edu/WCC/
- https://www.firstfriendschildcare.org/
- http://www.mywpl.org/

While you will not redesign the entire website, you should redesign 3-4 pages on the website. One of those pages must be the homepage. The others must be accessible from the homepage.

### The Report
Produce a slideshow that showcases your redesign.
Use Google Slides so you can use my laptop.

The first slide must only be screenshots of your sketches and redesign. 
Other groups will guess your demographics at this point.
Try to make it interesting (aka don't give it away)!

Once demographics are revealed, the rest of your talk should tell us about things like the major insights, design decisions, and processes you followed to arrive at your design.
